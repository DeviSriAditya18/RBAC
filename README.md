# users-management-system

I used React JS for frontend and Java & Springboot for backend.

In this project I created Users Management System along with Role Based Access Control(RBAC). Simply, I assumed 2 persons namely i.e., "ADMIN" and "USER". 
The admin is the responsible for all CRUD operations which means he can add, update and delete users and he can see the details of all users who are registerd.
Coming to the user, he can see only his details and also he can register. He can't update, delete and see the details of other users.
So, this will ensure the data safety.

Coming to data security, I developed this project such that when you want to add user or admin via postman, then we need JWT token. So if and only if admin has JWT token 
he can perform CRUD operations on details of the user.

So this is all about my project. And below are some sample images of this project.
